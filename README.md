# The Island ... A mystery

Simple old-style text adventure written in Ruby.

This is me getting back into the joys of from-scratch Ruby coding, and getting acquainted with some new language features.

```bash
$ bundle install
$ rake

You are at Cove Shores.
You stand alone on the beach. It's sunny, slightly breezey and fairly calm.
Gulls can be heard in the distance.
Here you can see:
 1) A piece of dry driftwood
 2) A sea shell
It's 8:00 AM
```
